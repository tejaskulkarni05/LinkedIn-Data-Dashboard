Curiosity over credentials\nExperience explains the past.\nCuriosity shapes the future.\n\n2. Resilience over résumés\nEvery role has storms.\nHire the ones who rise stronger.\n\n3. Ownership over titles\nNot “That’s not my job.”\nBut “I’ll take care of it.”\n\n4. Passion over polish\nSkills fade without fire.\nPassion fuels the hard days.\n\n5. Attitude over aptitude\nA good attitude lifts a team.\nA bad one poisons it.\n\n6. Growth mindset over “I know it all”\nThe best hires aren’t done climbing.\nThey’re hungry to keep going.\n\n7. Integrity over image\nA shiny résumé might impress.\nIntegrity builds trust that lasts.\n\nBecause in the end:\nThe right person will learn the job.\nThe wrong person will destroy the culture.\n\nHire for character.\nTrain for skill.\nProtect the culture.\n\nResumés don’t build legendary teams.\nPeople do.\n\n♻ Repost to help more leaders rethink hiring.\n➕ Follow Mike Leber for daily insights on leadership, growth & impact.\n\nImage credit: Rob Dance",

We are choosing this path to further build trust in Microsoft AI models, support the European AI ecosystem, and demonstrate our long-standing compliance with EU law, while recognizing that the AI Act is a complex regulation that would benefit from simplification.\n \nFor European organizations to grow, thrive, and compete globally with AI, European policymakers should leverage the upcoming digital simplification package and Forum for Signatories to refine and improve the AI Act and Code of Practice to set clear, practical, and well-supported paths to compliance.  \n \nWe look forward to working with the AI Office to implement the Code and contribute ideas for its improvement that are grounded in real-world practice and evolving international approaches.",

But what truly matters isn't the recognition—it's the privilege of doing what I do daily: helping founders from their inception to iconic journeys.\n\nAt Mayfield, “people first” isn’t just a motto – it’s our fundamental belief. Success in venture capital is never a solo achievement. My journey has been possible because of:\n-Our founders, who chose Mayfield as their partners\n\n- My Mayfield family, who challenge and partner with me daily\n\n- My family, which provides the foundation for everything\n\nOver three decades of building and investing in startups, I've learned that great people evolve, company building is a team sport, and all of us are better than any one of us. My leadership philosophy has been strongly influenced by observing the greatest coaches and championship teams in sports:\n- Establish a winning mindset from day one\n\n- Make bold decisions when others hesitate\n\n- Recognize every contributor, especially the unsung heroes\n\n- Create space for both fierce competition and genuine joy\n\nThe best founders I've worked with are always learning and changing. They see potential in others that they can't yet see in themselves and aren't afraid to embrace the unconventional.\n\nGreat teams win together. They celebrate together. And most importantly, they grow together.\n\nHere’s looking at you, John Zimmer, Logan Green, Manish Chandra, Armon Dadgar, Mitchell Hashimoto, Lyndon Rive, Anand Deshpande, Guru Pangal, Kumar Ramachandran, Manu Gulati, Murli Thirumale, Gou Rao, Ankur Singla, Rob Bearden, Dheeraj Pandey, Tarun Raisoni, Bill Gross, Faraj Aalaei, Rajiv K., Seshu Madhavapeddy, and Rehan Jalil.\n\nThank you to Iain Martin and Forbes for the recognition, our founders who are building the future of AI, and my team at Mayfield, who make coming to work every day fun.",
