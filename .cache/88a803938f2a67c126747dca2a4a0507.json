What started as a fascination with computer viruses turned into a lifelong journey of building solutions that protect millions of users with Quick Heal.\n\nWhether it’s coding, cybersecurity, art, or any craft you love, never underestimate its potential. The world needs people who are deeply passionate about what they do. \n\nYour hobby could be the foundation of your future business, it all starts with believing in its possibilities.\n\nThe key is to refine your skills, explore ways to solve a problem, and share your passion with the world. \n\nWith dedication and the right mindset, your hobby can evolve into a great business.\n\nWhat passion drives you?\nMaybe it’s time to take the next step! 🚀",

It has always been powered by people who believe in a future where cybersecurity is more inclusive, more innovative, and more human.\n\nTo CEFCYS - Cercle des Femmes de la CyberSécurité, thank you for recognising my work, and for championing women across our industry. Your mission matters, and I’m proud to stand alongside you.\n\nTo every woman in cybersecurity — entrepreneur, practitioner, leader, or aspiring professional — this award is as much yours as it is mine. \n\nKeep going. Keep showing up. Keep claiming your space. The world needs your brilliance now more than ever.\n\n💛 Here’s to building, lifting, and leading — together.\n\nFinally, to the person (or people) who nominated me — thank you. Your belief, your support, and your quiet advocacy behind the scenes mean more than you know. I appreciate you, and I’m TRULY grateful.\n\nI'm sharing a snippet of the full award ceremony where CEFCYS - Cercle des Femmes de la CyberSécurité are revealing the winner of this award but you can watch the whole ceremony here:\n👇👇 👇 \n\n\nThank you to Dr Ludmila Morozova-Buss for calling me to let me know I'd won. I was collecting my daughter from work, so was able to share the news immediately with her! 😊 \n\nHonoured to serve you,\nJane\n\nPS. Tomorrow I'm at Black Hat Executive Summit (EU) in London, and then back there again on Thursday to meet my IN Security scholarship winners. Hope to see you if you're going.",

        "post_text": "How I beat the competition without 50% of their features. \n\nHere’s how not to get stuck in a catch-up game with competitors.\n\nI still remember the early days of Quick Heal. Competing with MNCs like Norton and McAfee felt like David vs. Goliath. They had massive teams and long feature lists and I had neither.\n\nBut I had one thing: a deep focus on what really mattered to users. And that changed everything.\n\n👉 Lesson: Build for user value, not engineering perfection.\n\nStartups often fall into the trap of building \"the right way\"; perfect architecture, complete feature sets. But most of the time, that kills speed. And in the startup world, speed is survival.\n\nHere’s what worked for me (and still works today):\n1. Focus on the core problem your product solves\n2. Make those core features delightful and reliable\n3. Don’t chase feature parity, chase user satisfaction\n4. Release fast, learn faster\n5. Let real-world feedback guide your evolution\n\nWhile others raced to add features, I obsessed over making core functionality rock-solid and learning from customer feedback that eventually led us to create true differentiators.\n\nThis helped Quick Heal grow from a small Indian startup into a global cybersecurity brand used by millions.\n\nEvery Quick Heal release had just a few “hero features.” But they solved user pain so well, even MNCs began copying them.\n\nSo ask yourself:\nAre you building features just to tick boxes in a comparison sheet, or are you delivering real value based on what your users actually need today?\n\n𝘗.𝘚.
