Frustrations ran high.\nSometimes we fought, argued, lost our tempers.\nI still remember Kailash telling me:\n\"𝘠𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘦𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥.

We figured it out.\nAnd we built something together.\n\nToday, when I look back, I realize:\nWe couldn’t control where we started.\nBut we could control how far we were willing to go.\n\nSuccess isn’t just about resources or perfect conditions.\nSometimes, it’s about the grit built in ration lines,\nthe perseverance forged in everyday struggles,\nand the promise you make to yourself;\nto never give up, no matter what.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂.\n𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀.\n\n          \nQuick Heal Seqrite",

Last week I saw it become reality.\n\nDeep tech moment for me: \nWhen you stand next to India’s first Quantum Computer.\n\nLast week, I had the opportunity to visit QpiAI in Bangalore and witness something truly special, India’s first full-stack quantum computing system, QpiAI-Indus.\n\nStanding next to this marvel of science and technology, alongside Dr. Nagendra Nagaraja, the visionary Founder, CEO, and Chairman of QpiAI, was a surreal experience. It was the first time I ever saw a quantum computer in real life, and it left me in absolute awe.\n\nEarlier last year, I invested in QpiAI because I believed in their bold vision and today, I feel prouder than ever to be part of their journey.\n\nQpiAI isn’t just building a quantum computer. They’re building India’s quantum future.\n\nWith 25 superconducting qubits, QpiAI-Indus marks a giant leap for Indian deep-tech, showcasing full-stack capabilities across quantum hardware, quantum-HPC software, AI, and enterprise applications.\n\nQpiAI is shaping one of the world’s largest quantum talent ecosystems, right from India. 🇮🇳\n\nTo all young tech enthusiasts: the future isn't just coming, India is building it. And it's quantum-powered.\n\n📸 Sharing a photo with Dr. Nagaraja and QpiAI-Indus from my last weeks visit, a moment I’ll never forget.",
