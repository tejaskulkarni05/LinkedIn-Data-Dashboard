        "post_text": "Still taking it all in… 👇\n\n\nThis week, I had the incredible honour of receiving my MBE at Windsor Castle. Meeting Her Royal Highness Princess Anne and having the chance to speak with her was both humbling and unforgettable.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, everyone at Windsor Castle was calm, gracious, and welcoming. The entire day was seamless—truly a masterclass in ceremony (the Brits really do know how to do it!).\n\nWhat made it even more special was sharing it with my three children. Watching their faces take it all in is something I’ll never forget. A real gift.\n\nI’ll be sharing more photos and a little more about the conversation soon—but for now, just wanted to say how deeply grateful I am. \n\nFor those who’ve supported me along the way, thank you again.",

        "post_text": "Ouch - the viral \"Tea\" app, where women trade notes about the men they're dating, just got hacked. Here's what happened:\n\n* Just 24 hours ago, the app was massively viral sparking many debates about the ethics of the situation from all sides. \n\n* Apparently this viral app had NO SECURITY whatsoever, leaving all of the sensitive data of their users completely unprotected and publicly accessible.\n\n* With the massive viral attention, online trolls began probing for weakness and almost immediately found a public data store with all records exposed and unencrypted.\n\n* Women's verification photos and drivers licenses (!) got leaked, along with every message they had left on the site - all in plain text. \n\n* Given the extreme inattention to basic security, there is much speculation that the Tea app was vibe-coded (which means it was coded almost entirely with AI). I find this very plausible.\n\nPretty horrible outcome for everyone involved, and an extreme breach of confidence on the part of the Tea App developers. They had what looked like success - the viral moment, the public debate and even the  spot in the app store. \n\nIf they had instead took responsibility for these basic considerations themselves, they would've realized that they don't know what solution is best and would've sought out an expert - not just to get them to do the work but to have someone present who can evaluate the situation properly.\n\nTake this as (among many others) an important public lesson in overestimating what AI will solve for you. Don't overextend yourself when the stakes are high.\n\nOnly generate what you can evaluate!",
